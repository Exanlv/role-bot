Bot to handle roles on discord

# setting up
Run `npm install` & `npm start`, it'll yell at you what to do next. You need a server where the bot has permissions to upload emotes & a bot token

# automated tests
Run `npm install` & `npm test`, it'll yell at you what to do next. You need a dev server where the automated testing bot has permissions to create channels, ranks etc with a channel called 'testing' & 2 bot tokens.
